## todo list app - thought space 

### update ideas
- boards
- some music when something happens or maybe some background melody, maybe embeding some users favorite songs some for a default (if possible) and some could be chosen from the default possibility from somewhere else as well (just an idea), customizable not just this but for notifications maybe as well would depend on the user
- create a vibe or some sort of experience not just a todo list but the entire website from the beginning will be an experience 
- customize the figures not just circles but many other different shapes customizable by the user
- customizable backgrounds in its entirety some special themes by default or some possibility of importing
- some additional page for some motivational quotes that could change the day the mood etc, maybe you could even write some of your own quotes and even sharing them across friends and other users
- make the possibllity of other adding other users as friends to share not just the todo list tasks but their entire customizable website the design and everything to brag how They have it the motivational quotes as well so inspire some creativity and things like that 
- add deadlines for those tasks - those notifications for it 
- priority labels, some sublists some task could be quite long and making it into a sublist would help a lot especially we could also have some tutorial page where would be how to properly manage tasks there are many tutorials for these types of things that it is extremely important to have some systém with it and not be overwhelmed so that is something i would add for another page 
- progress tracking for the groups based on those tasks maybe even make something like this with sublists but it could be too much already with all the customizable design so maybe not just an idea
- maybe even your friends could not just share but even if you are not sharing They could of course only for added friend if you allow it They could look at your tasks and add or leave it with some notes, comments, feedback or something like that part of this could be included in free version and the rest in the paid one
- some sort of backup of tasks also? maybe
- voice integration could be interesting to add for the users to not have to add tasks manuály
- also maybe some another page that not only we have those quotes but some challenges could also be made especially for the tasks you could make a challenge with friend to make create or accomplish something, maybe even some completely public portal where you could also put your quotes and the challenge could be who will get the most likes would for example get some bonuses ( the paid version for free for some time etc..)
- maybe export and importing tasks from another websites

### Potential problems for the ideas

- overloading - shouldnt implement everything - would lead to too many possibilities would definitely overwhelm users - needed great working default - and have engaging tutorial that will explain the basics and some advanced tutorials for the rest - what is importat is great onboaring and default
- performace issues - absolutely needs optimalization
- some things would be a pain to program
- need to focus on a type of customers not everyone would want to use this todo list but many would



### monetarization (selling points)

- visual - the entire website as an experience - all of it written in update ideas
- limit on number of boards - 5 (can be changed later)
- limit on sharing 
- some special effects on notifications - especially with the music allowing the default for free and some custom like a few (as i said if possible) and if more then...
